How to download this (and other) CSMs:
 1. From github, click on the green "<> Code‚è∑" Button. From there, click "Download ZIP".
 2. Go to your Downloads folder. Extract the .zip file.
 3. Move the extracted file to the "clientmods" folder in your Minetest directory.
 4. If there is not already, create a text file, "mods.conf". Type in, "load_mod_captimer = true".
 5. Launch Minetest, go to settings, and enable client modding.
 6. All done!
